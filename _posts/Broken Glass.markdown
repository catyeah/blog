<p>Why are we afraid of broken glass
There are worse things
Like sitting ona cold cement hallway
Playing with a piece of string
Tying it too tight around my finger
Purple skin, like a marble on the end of a fleshy branch
Watching to see what might happen

There are worse things than broken glass
Like missing the midnight light on your eyelids
White skin shining, too pale to be real
Floating in and out of sleep
Half knowing, half wishing you'll be there in the morning
Now waking up alone
And finding, that's okay, feeling nearly nothing

THere are worse things than broken glass
Being frozen, paralyzed
Your body made of contorted steel bars
Inflexible, you try to breathe
Ragged oxygen crawling into your lungs
And your heart feels like it's been picked up by a claw machine
Clenched til it nearly goes out
Then thrown down a chute to a disappointed kid who spent too many quarters to get something already broken.

There are worse things than broken glass
Unable to move or think or breathe or live anything other than the imaginary hell around you
The longest two minutes or three hours of your life
Because what does time matter when you're dying?
It ends and you wait for it to come back
That old friend you pretend not to hate
Waiting for the black smoke to crawl in through the floorboards and cracked windows
Hiding in a corner
A shitty hiding place
Til it finds you, of course it finds you
It always finds you
And you live in fear of the smokey snake

There are worse things
But still
Your mother tells you to be careful, be afraid
Of broken glass</p>
